        <h3>The VLOK Tool</h3>
        <p>
          The VLOK Tool gives you fast, controlled access — in vehicles, buildings, and windows.
          <br><br>
          Hook it over a door hinge to hold it open, drop it in a vehicle’s striker bracket to stop latches from locking, or wedge it into a window track for airflow, routing, or quick entry.
          <br><br>
          No more slammed doors. No accidental lockouts. No wasted time.
          <br><br>
          Built for law enforcement, EMS, trades, and anyone working where doors and windows get in the way.
